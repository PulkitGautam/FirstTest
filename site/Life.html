    <h1> Life of Stephen Hawking </h1>
    <article>
    	<h3> Early Life </h3>
    	<section> Hawking began his schooling at the Byron House School in Highgate, London. He later blamed its "progressive methods" for his failure to learn to read while at the school.In St Albans, the eight-year-old Hawking attended St Albans High School for Girls for a few months. At that time, younger boys could attend one of the houses.Hawking attended two independent schools, first Radlett School and from September 1952, St Albans School, after passing the eleven-plus a year early.The family placed a high value on education.Hawking's father wanted his son to attend the well-regarded Westminster School, but the 13-year-old Hawking was ill on the day of the scholarship examination. His family could not afford the school fees without the financial aid of a scholarship, so Hawking remained at St Albans. </section>

    	<h3> Career </h3>
    	<section> In his work, and in collaboration with Penrose, Hawking extended the singularity theorem concepts first explored in his doctoral thesis.In 1970, Hawking postulated what became known as the second law of black hole dynamics, that the event horizon of a black hole can never get smaller.With James M. Bardeen and Brandon Carter, he proposed the four laws of black hole mechanics, drawing an analogy with thermodynamics.His results, which Hawking presented from 1974, showed that black holes emit radiation, known today as Hawking radiation, which may continue until they exhaust their energy and evaporate.Initially, Hawking radiation was controversial. By the late 1970s and following the publication of further research, the discovery was widely accepted as a significant breakthrough in theoretical physics. </section>

    		Hawking explained in His Book <b> <i> A Brief History of Time </i> </b> : <br> <br> &emsp;&emsp; <quote> <i> "If the universe has no boundaries but is self-contained... then God would not have had any freedom to choose how the universe began." </i> </quote> <br> <br>
